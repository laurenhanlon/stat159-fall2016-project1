## Introduction

As noted in the abstract, the tools I write about in this paper are: _Makefile, Git, GitHub, Pandoc and Markdown_. In putting together this project, I used each one of these tools in their respective manners. I used _Markdown_ to format this paper for the purpose of readability and the ability to incorporate links, photos as well as blocks of code. A _Makefile_ was used to put together the entire paper, meaning that it concats each of the sections to create a full-length paper. _Pandoc_ is used within the Makefile to convert the Markdown to HTML. I then used _Git_ to upload this project to _GitHub_, where it will be displayed to the world! If you didnâ€™t understand any of that read on to learn what each of these tools do :)
