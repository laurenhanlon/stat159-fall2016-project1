## Abstract

This is a project for [Statistics 159: Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science][stat159]. The purpose of this project is to explain some of the common tools that are used in data science, that not only make the data scientistâ€™s life easier, but also help others who are trying to understand or replicate their projects. The tools I go over in this paper include Makefile, Git, GitHub, Pandoc and Markdown.
