## Conlusion

In conclusion, reproducible and collaborative data science is made *10x easier* with just a few simple tools that are fairly easy to learn. Markdown can be used to format papers and descriptions of projects and Pandoc can then convert this Markdown into another readable format such as pdf or HTML. A Makefile can automate all of that with just a few simple lines, and Makefiles allow others to reproduce your work quickly and easily. Git and GitHub interact with one another to easily update your project from your local computer, and then allows the rest of the community to raed, contribute to, or reproduce your work!
